                I was born in Italy, in 1992. Specifically in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso" target="_blank">Treviso</a>, a small town in the north-east of Italy.

                I am currently revolutionising my life. I recently moved to Vancouver, Canada. I left academia. Here, Iâ€™m eager to start a new career in industry, working with data, coding, and state-of-the-art technologies and start-ups.
            </p>

                I grew up in the Venetian countryside, quite close to Venice and in the land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco" target="_blank">prosecco</a>. Through the years, I developed different passions: piano, football (and sports in general), technologies, philosophy, and, most of all, astronomy.

                This last one brought me to amazing places. I lived in Palma de Mallorca (October 2022 - October 2024) and worked as a postdoc researcher at the Universitat de les Illes Balears. Before that, I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin" target="_blank">Szczecin</a> for 4 years (October 2018 - October 2022), a town in the north-west of Poland, where I studied to be a Ph.D. in astrophysics.

                There, I met my lovely finance, Sara.

                I used to work on Gravitational Waves, mostly on lensing of gravitational waves. You can find more information about that <a href="CV.html">at this link</a>. The group I was working with in Spain specializes in Gravitational Waves, while the <a href="http://cosmo.usz.edu.pl/" target="_blank">one</a> I worked with in Szczecin is very theoretical. Generally, I prefer data and observation! In fact, I graduated in astronomy in Padova in September 2017, after a year in Stockholm with the Erasmus project, where I worked on my master thesis.

                Since I started working and could afford it, I like to travel quite a lot, <a href="extras.html#wandering">and I love "being around"</a>. I've been to many places in Europe, like England, Spain, Sweden (and Lapland!), Romania, and not many outside it (yet)... can't wait for the next one. I particularly fell in love with Portugal and large parts of America (<a href="blogs/mexico.html" target="_blank">Mexico</a>, USA, Chile, and Canada, where I currently live).

                I love reading random stuff, usually. If you're curious, you can find a (not complete but updated) list <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/51537115-paolo-cremonese?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <p>
                Finally, I've come to like running a lot. I have run 2 half marathons and some 10k races. Also, even though lately I've neglected it, I enjoy riding <a href="images/my_bike.jpeg">my bike</a> when I can. You can find my little progress <a href="extras.html#bike">here</a>.

            My quest to understand the world started in the first year of my master's degree.
