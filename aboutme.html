                I was born in Italy, in 1992. Specifically in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso" target="_blank">Treviso</a>, a small town in the north-east of Italy.

                I am currently revolutionising my life. I recently moved to Vancouver, Canada. I left academia. Here, I’m eager to start a new career in industry, working with data, coding, and state-of-the-art technologies and start-ups.
            </p>

            <p>
                I grew up in the Venetian countryside, quite close to Venice and in the land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco" target="_blank">prosecco</a>. Through the years, I developed different passions: piano, football (and sports in general), technologies, philosophy, and, most of all, astronomy.

                This last one brought me to amazing places. I lived in Palma de Mallorca (October 2022 - October 2024) and worked as a postdoc researcher at the Universitat de les Illes Balears. Before that, I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin" target="_blank">Szczecin</a> for 4 years (October 2018 - October 2022), a town in the north-west of Poland, where I studied to be a Ph.D. in astrophysics.

                There, I met the best person I know, my lovely finance, Sara. Sara is the kind of person that is constantly trying to improve herself and the world around her. As you can image, after many years of self improvement, she is now amazing at her job - she holds an MD and a bachelor in Physics and soon a PhD in nuclear medicine - and even more amazing as a human being. We will get married in the spring of 2026.

                I used to work on Gravitational Waves, mostly on lensing of gravitational waves. You can find more information about that <a href="CV.html">at this link</a>. The group I was working with in Spain specializes in Gravitational Waves, while the <a href="http://cosmo.usz.edu.pl/" target="_blank">one</a> I worked with in Szczecin is very theoretical. Generally, I prefer data and observation! In fact, I graduated in astronomy in Padova in September 2017, after a year in Stockholm with the Erasmus project, where I worked on my master thesis.

                Since I started working and could afford it, I like to travel quite a lot, <a href="extras.html#wandering">and I love "being around"</a>. I've been to many places in Europe, like England, Spain, Sweden (and Lapland!), Romania, and not many outside it (yet)... can't wait for the next one. I particularly fell in love with Portugal and large parts of America (<a href="blogs/mexico.html" target="_blank">Mexico</a>, USA, Chile, and Canada, where I currently live).

                I love reading random stuff, usually. If you're curious, you can find a (not complete but updated) list <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/51537115-paolo-cremonese?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read" target="_blank">here</a>.

        </br>
            <p>
                Finally, I've come to like running a lot. I have run 2 half marathons and some 10k races. Also, even though lately I've neglected it, I enjoy riding <a href="images/my_bike.jpeg">my bike</a> when I can. You can find my little progress <a href="extras.html#bike">here</a>.

            <h2>My quest to understand the world</h2>
        </header>
    <main class="blog-layout">
        <article>
            <p>My quest to understand the world started in the first year of my master's degree.</p><br>
            
            <p>Up to that point, I had very cool courses—like the study of galaxies, for example, or how stars are born and develop. These are super fascinating subjects, but I always had this itch in my mind, this urge to ask myself: "Okay, but then what?"</p><br>
            
            <p>For example, we know that if galaxies have a certain mass, they develop in a specific way and might become spiral galaxies. But then, okay—what's next?</p><br>
            
            <p>This feeling persisted through most of my courses until I started taking cosmology.</p><br>
            
            <p>Cosmology is probably the single coolest subject I've ever encountered. It tries to answer the fundamental question: How did the universe come to be the way it is now? And therefore, by default also, what’s going to happen next?</p><br>
            
            <p>The fascinating thing about cosmology is that it is always by definition a “what’s next” quest. The Earth revolves around the Sun. OK, then? The Sun with all the planets travels through the galaxy. OK, then? Our galaxy is one of billions in the Universe. OK, then? Beyond our Galaxy, the Universe is composed mostly of unknown dark matter and some visible one, and they interact in some ways. OK, then? This interaction is what first allowed the matter to create stars, galaxies….you got the idea. It is never-ending. But it is not just that, every layer is deeper than the previous, and it feels like you are digging to find some treasure.</p><br>
            
            <p>Moreover, another mesmerizing thing about cosmology is that you cannot disentangle the time and space of your search. Looking far away in space means looking far away in the past.</p><br>
            
            <p>When you're trying to understand the universe and how it came to be, it's very hard for me to ask myself "And then what?" because you're literally studying how everything—including us—came into existence. Answering - or better asking - these questions always feels incredibly satisfying.</p><br>
            
            <p>But here's the thing: The quest to understand the universe being never-ending, you either stop when you die or decide to stop earlier.</p><br>
            
            <p>I chose the latter.</p><br>
            
            <p>It wasn’t a difficult decision. I’m really satisfied with my research career, and at the same time, over the past few years, I started studying a bit of finance. I find it fascinating, almost as much as cosmology. What I mean is that finance also tries to explain the history and structure of our modern world, helping us understand it to the best of our ability.</p><br>
            
            <p>But there’s an irrational aspect to finance that cosmology doesn’t have. In cosmology, once you correctly apply the laws of physics and have accurate data, the result is clear—it’s not going to change because of external factors like weather or human emotions. This is because we - for now, at least - cannot change the path of planets or stop the universe from expanding.</p><br>
            
            <p>In finance, however, we are by definition shaping our own world. This introduces so many pseudo-random variables—some predictable, some not—which makes finance both fascinating and challenging to deeply understand. This is because it stands at the crossroads of many disciplines: economics, mathematics, statistics, but also philosophy and psychology.</p><br>
            
            <p>But, I think, it gives you also an invaluable key to read the world and a great push on the quest to understand it.</p><br>
